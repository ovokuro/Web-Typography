// How to use the typography variables in SASS

1.  CHOOSE A TYPEFACE 
    
    Each typeface has different requirements for legibility.
    Example: line-height, line-lengths, color (e.g. dark-mode), usage etc
    
    
2.  CHOOSE AN APPROPRIATE LINE SPACING VALUE
  
    As a guide, about (1.5 * font-size)
    This is trial and error, shorter line-lengths typically require a smaller value
    Line spacing is affected by background color (dark background - increase spacing)
    
    
3.  GET THE CAP HEIGHT 

    Easiest method I've found is to
    1. Open up Illustrator
    2. Type the letter 'H'
    3. Pick the font you'll be using
    4. Set the font-size to 100px
    5. Using the ruler or line tool, measure the height of the H
    6. That height is a percentage value
    7. If the value is 75 - set the cap-height to 0.75


4.  ALIGN TEXT TO THE BASELINE

    Set up a vertical grid on HTML and make sure it corresponds to line-spacing
    Text needs to be offset to line up with the baseline.
    To get the offset value:
        ((line-height - cap-height) * font-size) / 2
        We multiply by the font size to ensure a pixel value
    
    For an element, set margin-top = $offset and margin-bottom = -1 * $offset
    
    
5.  CREATE A UTILITY CLASS FOR BACKGROUND

    Parents with background will appear to overflow container
    because of child negative margin
    Use padding: .1px 0 (hack)
    

6.  CREATE SIZING CLASSES

    create a set of sizing classes for padding based off line-height to space elements
    


Finally...
    Round everything
